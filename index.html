  <h3>Information about us:</h3>
  <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>Health Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc.</b></h3>
    <p>In 1983 Bonnie Williams, daughter of respected Maryville resident Inez Bowman, 
        told her mother about an emergency response system that was available in Iowa City,
         IA.  She thought her mother might be interested in the program.  Inez was intrigued 
         by the concept and brought it to the Maryville Citizens for Community Action (MCCA) 
         for consideration.  The MCCA Human Resources Task Force thought it warranted further
          investigation and approached St. Francis Hospital to see if they would be interested 
          in establishing the program.  The Hospital had already heard of the program and they 
          were considering it.</p>
    </br>
    <p>A committee, consisting of Martin Goedken from St. Francis Hospital, Mildred Davis, 
            Inez Bowman and Donna Holt traveled to St. Joseph, MO to talk to the Lifeline volunteer
             coordinator to see how their organization operated.  After this meeting the St. Francis 
             Hospital administration decided that the funds were not available to buy the units necessary
              to begin the program.  Undaunted, a group of individuals decided to undertake the program.
    </p>
<p> Frank strong volunteered to help file the articles of incorporation that were signed by Inez Bowman 
        as vice president, Bob Bush as president and Donna Holt as treasurer.  On May 11, 1984, the Health 
        Emergency Lifeline Program (HELP) became a not-for-profit corporation.  A federal tax number was issued 
        to the new organization on October 18, 1984.  The all-volunteer organization known as, the Health 
        Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc. was born.
</p>
<p>The first contract with Lifeline Systems, Inc., whose home office is in Massachusetts, was signed on June 
        29, 1984.  The units and new response center were shipped, and the first installation was set up for 
        Wednesday, August 22, 1984 at 11:00 a.m. for Florence Zimmerman.  It was quite a media event KQTV out
         of St. Joseph, MO and local media attending.</p>
<p>Funding to start the program came from two large donations.  The St. Francis Hospital Auxiliary donated 
        $5,000 and the Business and Professional Women (BPW) donated $5,000 that had come to them from a bequest. 
         Officers of HELP decided to lease the equipment rather than purchase it outright.  
         This turns out to have been a wise decision.  HELP would not have been able to expand the program if the 
         home units and response center had to be purchased.  At the time, individual units cost $495 and the 
         response center $7,000.
</p>
<p>Leasing has allowed HELP to stay current with the latest technology.  The life of each lease is five years. 
         When the time period for each lease is ended, HELP’s Executive Committee seeks approval from its Board of 
         Directors to enter a new lease for the same number, a lesser number or a greater number of units.  
         That decision is driven by whether there are several names on the waiting list.  With over 150 units in 
         service in 2008, the program continues to be a valuable resource for Nodaway county community members and
          those living in the surrounding area whose doctors utilize St. Francis Hospital and Health Services. 
           In the summer of 2004, the volunteers who operate the program were happy to celebrate 20 years of dedicated
            service and caring for their neighbors through the Health Emergency Lifeline Program.
</p>
<p>In 2011 a transition from site monitoring at St. Francis Hospital to central monitoring from a location 
        in Massachusetts was successfully completed.  This change occurred because the site monitoring unit at
         St. Francis would become obsolete in 2012-- no longer able to be serviced.  Site monitoring was free;
          central monitoring carries a monthly charge for each unit monitored. HELP has converted all program units
           from leased to owned property over the past 5 years with the return of the final leased units to Lifeline 
           in February 2015.  The commitment to ownership allows HELP to keep costs as affordable as possible to our 
           Nodaway County subscribers.  
</p>
<p> HELP current inventory has declined due to the discontinuance of the first digital units (DT 1000) and 
        rollovers, we currently have an inventory of 88 units which includes the addition of cellular based 
        units. HELP still has some DT 1000s in use and are gradually replacing them as they fail to work. 
         Future purchases will include both landline (6900 Model Units) and cellular (7000 Series Units) 
         communicators.  In addition, there are units now being used that are mobile and do not use a base 
         communicator.  Communication is all through the button.
</p>
<p>
        Since 1984, HELP has served 1,155 subscribers as of 2019.  Of the current subscribers, 78 have had 
        Lifeline between one to ten years; 6 have had Lifeline over ten years of which 2 subscribers have 
        received services for more than 15 years.  Remaining in the security and comfort of their own home has 
        been a reality for these valued members of our community.
